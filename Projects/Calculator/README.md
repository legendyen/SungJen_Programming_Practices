**Project description**

A calculator that runs on command line.


**Motivation**

Practice control flow (loops, nested loops, continue, break) and functions that return value.


**How to use:**
1. When you see "ON:", enter a number
2. Then enter the operation symbols (plus: +, minus: -, multlipy: *, divide: /, VAT: tax)
3. If you enter "tax", the calculator will ask for the two-letter state abbreviation (e.g. New York= NY)
4. You will get "Result: XXX"
5. Press "Enter" to continue (accumulate the current result) or "Space" to clear all (back to zero)
6. You can enter "OFF" (case insensitive) whenever a calculation is over
